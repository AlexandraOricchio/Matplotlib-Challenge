# Matplotlib-Challenge
A burgeoning pharmaceutical company that specializes in drug-based, anti-cancer pharmaceuticals has begun screening for potential treatments to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. The challenge objective is to analyze the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.

Using Python Matplotlib, I created the following visuals to base my analysis on: 

- A scatter plot showing how tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.
- A scatter plot showing how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment.
- A scatter plot showing the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate).
- A bar graph comparing the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.
